## Prerequisites

### General 
This is a code-intensive workshop. We will be writing in Javascript for the Web browser. We won't be doing much HTML or CSS, but you'll be interacting with the HTML DOM quite a bit.

NOTE: Even if you decide not to code along with the group, you can still learn a lot from the workshop. 


### Skills
The following skills will come in handy:

 * Strong Javacript skills
 * Solid understanding of HTML DOM
 * Working understanding of HTTP
 * Experience with HTML and CSS
 * Knowledge of REST and Hypermedia

### Bring Along
Bring a laptop that has access to (or has installed locally):
 
 * NodeJS (to host local web projects)
 * Chrome Web browser (preferred, but not required)
 * Your favorite text editor (I will use VIM on stage)
 * Manually add the SSID : `vummiv` (no password)

### Accounts
The following free accounts will come in handy:

 * Github account (source code is kept in a repo)
 * Gitter account (we have a real-time chat channel available)
 * Heroku account (if you wish to push your project to a public server)
